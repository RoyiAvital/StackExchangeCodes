## To Do List

 *	[The Kernel in the Guided Image Filter](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/42415).  
	Try again using the equations in [Guided Image Filtering](https://www.scribd.com/document/421510148/Guided-Image-Filtering).
 *	[AR Model Estimation Using LMS](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/59325).
 *	[System Identification with a Limited Bandwidth Input Signal and Region of Interest](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/59664).  
	Try to come up with regularization (Maybe in the frequency domain?) to solve this.
 *	[Estimate Instantaneous Frequency Using LMS Algorithm](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/63886).  
	Check if it works for really low frequencies.
 *	[Sequential Form of the Least Squares Estimator for Linear Least Squares Model](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/54730).  
	Add derivation for the case of Forgetting Sequential LS and for Weighted Sequential LS. Probably better done in different questions.
 *	[Feature Extraction for Image Classification of Vegetables and Fruits Using Classic Computer Vision Techniques](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/79159).  
	Create a simple example using MATLAB and some feature extractor.
 *	[What is the relationship between beamforming and Independent Component Analysis (ICA)](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/82978).
 * 	[Image Processing Pipeline for Segmenting Cell Nuclei](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/83097).
 * 	[Which Discrete Non Linear, Time Invariant Systems with Memory are Considered "Easy" to Model and Identify](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/60805).
 *	[How to Calculate Gaussian Kernel for a Small Support Size](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/23460)  
	Suggest doing it in Frequency Domain with a direct calculation on the frequency domain of the kernel.  
	Related to [Constructing a Gaussian Kernel in the Frequency Domain](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/73687), [Is the Discrete Gaussian Kernel an Eigenfunction of the DFT](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/10429) and [A Survey of Gaussian Convolution Algorithms](https://www.ipol.im/pub/art/2013/87/).
 *	[Unscented Kalman Filter for Tracking Amplitude, Frequency and Phase of a Multi Component Signal](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/84361).
